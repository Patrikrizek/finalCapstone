TASK MANAGER

## Project description
This is a project of the task manager created in Python. I wanted to create
something more complex with multiple options in the navigation menu. The
application will request you to log in at the beginning. After successfully
login the menu appears. You can choose from: Registering a user, Adding a
task, View all tasks, View my task, Generate reports (admin only), Display
statistics or Exit the application.
